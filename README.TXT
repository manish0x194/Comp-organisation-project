RISC-V Assembler
A simple assembler that converts RISC-V RV32I assembly code into binary machine code.

Features
Supports RV32I instruction set.
Converts assembly to 32-bit RISC-V machine code.
Outputs binaries for simulation or execution.
Usage
Write RISC-V assembly code.
Run the assembler to generate machine code.
Use the binary with a simulator or emulator.
